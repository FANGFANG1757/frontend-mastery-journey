## January 2025 - Week 1: HTML Semantics + Accessibility

### Monday, January 6, 2025
**Focus**: Project setup and HTML structure  
**Time**: 2.5 hours (7:00-9:30 PM)

#### What I Learned
- Set up the complete study plan repository structure
- Reviewed HTML5 semantic elements and their proper usage
- Understanding of landmarks: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`
- Difference between `<section>` and `<article>` elements

#### What I Built
- Created TechShop e-commerce homepage structure
- Implemented basic HTML skeleton with semantic elements
- Set up project folders and TODO comments for guided learning
- Organized the complete 24-week study plan repository

#### Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Understanding when to use `<section>` vs `<article>`
- **Solution**: Found that `<article>` should be standalone content (like product cards), `<section>` for thematic groupings

#### Key Insights
- Semantic HTML isn't just about structure‚Äîit's about meaning and accessibility
- TODO comments are helpful for guided learning and staying focused
- Good project organization from the start saves time later

#### Resources Used
- [MDN: HTML Semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)
- [HTML5 Element Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

#### Tomorrow's Plan
- Implement skip link and accessibility features
- Add proper ARIA attributes and labels
- Start hero section with proper heading hierarchy
